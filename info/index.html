            <div class="one-liner">In 2020, Madeline Greenberg asked three artists to
                create a
                portrait of her based on a shared portfolio of her personal data.
                <br><br>
                <a class="italicize" href="https://madelinesnotes.cloud/">madelinesnotes.cloud</a> is the data
                portrait created
                by <a href="https://mayaontheinter.net/" target="_blank">Maya
                    Man</a>...
            </div>
            <br>
            When Madeline sent over the Google Drive folder containing all of her personal data, I kept thinking about
            those common
            refrains spoken in conversations around digital surveillance: "I've done nothing wrong," some will say, or
            "I have
            nothing to hide." Overall, yeah, this may very well be true. But that doesn't mean there aren't still
            things
            you would
            probably rather keep private. Asked to create a "portrait" of Madeline based on her data usage, I wondered
            what kind of
            files I might find that felt like the "would rather keep private" kind...
            <br><br>
            As I moved from her Google Search history to her Instagram messages to her Spotify playlists, I felt like I
            was slowly
            putting together a puzzle of a person. I was unsure what aspect I wanted to focus on for her portrait until
            I found a
            folder nested inside of her Apple data that held every entry she had typed into her Notes app since 2017.
            Reading
            through that felt criminally invasive, like reading her diary. Or maybe more like reading her
            mind. I felt
            like her heart was on the screen in a way it can never quite be when we're sharing content online that's
            intended for an
            unknowable, ever expanding audience. The notes she typed over the years into Apple's app on her phone or
            laptop were
            clearly always intended for herself and herself alone.
            <br><br>
            Combing through the files, I learned that her mom passed away when she was 13 years old. She gets her
            eyebrows waxed and
            recently got her ears pierced. She previously attended NYU before transferring to Brown. I learned that
            she's Jewish. In
            the fall of 2018, she travelled abroad, got high, and made new friends. She's dairy free. She reads often,
            wears makeup,
            wants to write a play, and is part of a sorority. She's extremely driven and self-reflective. She
            actively questions
            herself and the world around her.
            <br><br>
            None of this information was gleaned because her phone tracked her location, listened in on her
            conversations, or
            analyzed her search/browsing history. All of these details were self reported and recorded by Madeline
            herself.
            Thoughts, to-do lists, dreams, important addresses... it was all written there for her own safe keeping.
            <br><br>
            In her manifesto <a class="italicize" href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/3668-glitch-feminism"
                target="_blank">Glitch
                Feminism</a>,
            Legacy Russell writes that "the machine is a material through which we
            process our
            bodily experience." A physical notebook, journal, or diary has long served as a way for us to process our
            experiences,
            but what does that exercise look like (and <span class="italicize">feel</span> like) when our digital
            version of those tools
            is uploaded to
            the cloud?
            <br><br>
            I'd like to end by highlighting some words Madeline typed into her Notes app on December 10, 2020: "Ghost in
            the machine.
            What is the soul, the self, if you can open up the brain?"
