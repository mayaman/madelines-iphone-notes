                At the time my mother knew, more than I did, that she was not going to be able to share many more
                moments
                with me as she
                passed away from breast cancer when I was 13 years old. It was the first time, standing with other
                jewish
                women with
                bowed and covered heads, that we looked at each other and cried. Held each other and knew that there was
                not
                much more
                time that we could have to share. That the notes for health that were going into the wall were not going
                to
                work. That
                God no matter how powerful was not going to be able to save her or me from what was going to happen
                next. It
                was that
                moment that I felt that I could finally see what was coming. The year of falling, sinking into the
                sickness,
                and then
                eventually never waking up. In that moment at the wall together it was ok, it was gods plan, it was a
                holy
                sentence.

                I’m sad but
                happy. Love you and thinking about you. I remember the days of Harry Potter behind my seder, and mom
                wearing pearls and
                smelling vaguely like hairspray and her perfume. And I remember her outfits and the shoes that she would
                match
                perfectly. The fact that we would usually sit with grandma Roberta and my Jacob. That she would always
                have tissues in
                her purse and we would sometimes sneak a mint when we were starving as we headed into hour three of
                services. That you
                would sleep and only sometimes wake up for the sermon. Love you.

                Adventure madeline is on the loose. She is not taking no for an answer as she finds friends in cool
                places and people
                that sell weed. It is a strange world. One with crazy drunk people and David Cross just passes you on
                the street.
                <br><br>
                Madeline was on a mission. Be happy again. It was a difficult one. One with many memories lost and new
                Ones found. She
                has a sidekit. Rosario is my best friend and pet rabbit. But she doesn’t poop as much. She is also slow
                to respond.
                Annoying.
                <br><br>

                Anyway adventure madeline was in Prague talking to a loser about philosophy she turned around and went
                out to look with
                the popular kids.
                <br><br>

                There wasn’t any pot to be found. Until they asked a nice girl at a new bar and she showed them the way.
                <br>
                <br>
                Then they got High
                And all was well. The end.

                <br>
                Going to a chorus line and mom holding up the tank top and telling me I'd grow into the smallest size
                <br>
                <br>
                Heeliyinf back and forth through her office hallway while she talked on the phone
                Looking at her globe
                Her typing with Nails and how fast of a typist she was
                I remember she really was special Period
                It's the hardest part that she would have been the best grandma because grandma Berta and my kids won't
                Why is that
                How about I remember when seriously being in bathrooms together in Disney
                The smell when I go back reminds me of her
                Wow ok
                I guess so does being there her Minnie Mouse jacket
                That I donated. No it's been five years. But I'm not ok for ten.
                What else? I remember Eddie and Seth wrestling at my pirate party
                In the playroom and I thought Seth was going to die
                That was before Eddie became reliably an Eddie
                I am very tired and I want to go to sleep. I think if i go to sleep right now then I would never get to

                there
                I was her favorite person to see, everyone else was not as special. I don't have that with anyone else

                Tension between striving for more and contentment for what is

                Layman terms - position in a life story and then move from there

                When happiness is conidtional, are you postponing your joy

                Do you ignore your happy self future prospects

                Even more important: never underestimate a volcano -- for humans cannot tame them and one of these large
                scale eruptions
                could happen any day, at any time.
                <br><br>
                With the looming threat of eruption, the volcano stands against the horizon as a grim warning of what is
                to come. There
                is no way to predict when the threat will strike, only a way to study its movements and hope for a
                warning.

                Hi Madeline---<br>
                Good questions---would take it about the same time everyday---the levels are more consistent.
                Would avoid excessive alcohol while on this medicine--one glass of wine or one beer once or twice a week
                should be fine.
                Was thinking about medications Madeline---the Citalopram is a good choice though it has some
                interactions with some
                antibiotics ----was thinking Prozac--Fluoxetine might be good choice as it doesn't have those issues and
                you won't feel
                bad if you miss a dose once in awhile.
                If agreeable to you--would like to prescribe Fluoxetine 20mg--have you take 1/2 tablet (10 mg) in the
                morning starting
                tomorrow for the next 5 days--if you are feeling well--then you can go up to the whole tablet after
                that.
                The side effects some can notice are mild headache or nausea. Those usually will dissapate as your body
                get

                Cliff and Diana, <br>
                I hope that coming off of the holiday rush has gone well! I just wanted to send a note that I ended up
                getting some new
                earrings that I’m super excited about! They are a slightly more mature step in terms of that jewelry
                that I usually
                wear. Sending love your way!!

                not wanting
                anything. I was told not to let my feelings out. To just talk about the things that make me happy and
                not the things
                that were too hard. I don’t know. There’s a lot here. But I finally have wants. For the first time. In a

                I love you but I dont want you. What does that mean. There is a sense of respect. There is a sense that
                there are so few
                people in the world that matter. That continue to matter even as I start to realize that the person that
                I thought
                mattered actually doesn’t. Being smart is not the same as being motivated. So what about someone that is
                smart and
                motivated? I love them. I want them to love me. Not to want me. I want to be close to them. For them to
                be proud of me,
                I want to prove that I deserve their pride. I want them to see me and introduce me as their own, to
                share things with
                me, to know that I will get their jokes. That is so inherently different from wanting someone.
                <br><br>
                I do want someone. I want her and I want to be with her. Thinking about being with her does make me sad,
                because it is
                not going to happen again, but that doesn’t make me not want her. She makes me feel this longing.
                Touching her made me
                want to touch her more. I wanted her to find me beautiful, to not be able to stop being with me. To not
                want to leave.
                And she didn’t. She told me that I was beautiful, that I deserved to be lauded for the work that I had
                done. That she
                was proud, that the people around me were proud. And in the dark. During the movie, I wanted to make her
                blush. I wanted
                to hold her hand. I wanted to do more than hold her hand. That is wanting. That is desire for someone.
                physically.
                lustingly, wanting. When I think about her I feel like I could reach out and she would be there again
                and there would be
                nothing better in the world.
                <br><br>
                It is not that. It is disgust if they were there. Not at them. At myself. At the touching, at the
                closeness, the
                physical becomes corrupted. There is a sense of disappointment. Of general distrust, loss. So no. I do
                not want them,
                but I want what they have. I want someone smart enough to write a book. I want to have two children to
                homeschool, to
                work through potty training. I want to be so proud of the work that my partner did that I use her as a
                reference often
                and proudly. I want us both to teach at the same school, read the same books, tell each other what we
                did during the day
                that fascinated us. That made us feel alive. I didn’t find that yet. But I found part. For the first
                time, I found the
                part that makes sense even before I have to think about it.

                And I was their god. But my name was Natalie. But they had museums about me. The world was disney themed
                because I liked
                it so much.<br><br>

                There was a cute boy. But they found me out because my money said United States. He saw my id. He didn’t
                believe that it
                was me. He didn’t know what to do.<br><br>

                The Mickey Mouse ride was like the haunted mansion.<br><br>

                The museum was like moma. </div>

                The data body <br><br>

                What exists only in the virtual world? No - look to science fiction. Die in the matrix then die in real
                life.<br><br>

                Star Trek episode I thought she was only in my mind<br><br>

                Ghost in the machine. What is the soul, the self if you can open up the brain?<br><br>

                The neural net is of human of machine. It performs functions that we can point to as human but in
                contents that are
                inhuman by nature. Made by us for us. Iterations of the original tools that propose alternative
                spaces.<br><br>

                We imagine the not yet here in two ways - the utopic and the dystopic.<br><br>

                Think Jose Munoz for utopia. The means of emergent strategy. Constantly looking to a queered future of
                possibility
                enables the conceptions of the data body to aggregate in a mindset of positivity. As in - algorithms are
                programmed by
                humans. Humans can plan for the pain and demise of others for best uses of power. Or there can be an
                active attempt to
                imagine a queer futurity. Where the creation of the future is not yet here always.
                <br><br>
                But we fall to dystopia because that is what is known. That is the present. We are carefully situated in
                matrixes that
                allow us to break from dystopic practices if we so desire, but we are cycling through a society that
                builds bodies for
                their personal gain rather than in order to support inspire owe others.
                <br><br>
                Cylons, terminator, ghost in the machine, neon genesis evangelion —
                <br><br>
                These are examples of the data body and the human body in conversation. They combine the utopia and
                dystopic. The
                merging of the human with circuitry creates the possible, the cyborg. The infinite reinterpretation of
                the body as
                natural and singular through the addition of what we have made.
                <br><br>
                It is the glitches, the ghosts, the angels that remind us, however, that there is a present. And while
                we should be
                actively attempting to create a utopia future, we can’t forget that it must be queered.
                <br><br>
                So these failures, the malfunctions, the appearing loss of control, though it is the manifestation of
                fears regarding
                the new and not yet understood, perhaps it also represents the possible reminder of humanness at its
                core.
                <br><br>
                Why we are reminded over and over that San Junipero terminator is human. She is base us. She is base we.
