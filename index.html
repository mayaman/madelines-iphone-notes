It was the first time, standing with other jewish women with bowed and covered heads, that we looked at each other and cried. Held each other and knew that there was not much more time that we could have to share. That the notes for health that were going into the wall were not going to work. That God no matter how powerful was not going to be able to save her or me from what was going to happen next. It was that moment that I felt that I could finally see what was coming. The year of falling, sinking into the sickness, and then eventually never waking up. In that moment at the wall together it was ok, it was gods plan, it was a holy sentence.">

And I remember her outfits and the shoes that she would match perfectly. The fact that we would usually sit with grandma Roberta and my Jacob. That she would always have tissues in her purse and we would sometimes sneak a mint when we were starving as we headed into hour three of services. That you would sleep and only sometimes wake up for the sermon. Love you.">

Madeline was on a mission. Be happy again. It was a difficult one. One with many memories lost and new Ones found. She has a sidekit. Rosario is my best friend and pet rabbit. But she doesn’t poop as much. She is also slow to respond. Annoying. 

Anyway adventure madeline was in Prague talking to a loser about philosophy she turned around and went out to look with the popular kids. 

There wasn’t any pot to be found. Until they asked a nice girl at a new bar and she showed them the way. 

Then they got High

It was a lovely day
That started at ney nearly 7:16 ndjdjbsmkfnnfjdjxnndjdjjdbsbska

I’m sorry I am high lol as ballz 

There once was a young girl named madeline 
Who loves pararegiamorjiano cheese and 

Going to a chorus line and mom holding up the tank top and telling me I’d grow into the smallest size 

Heeliyinf back and forth through her office hallway while she talked on the phone 
Looking at her globe 
Her typing with Nails and how fast of a typist she was 
I remember she really was special   Period 
It’s the hardest part that she would have been the best grandma because grandma Berta and my kids won’t 
Why is that 
 Cathy as grandma? 
How about I remember when seriously being in bathrooms together in Disney 
The smell when I go back reminds me of her 
Wow ok 
I guess so does being there her Minnie Mouse jacket 
That I donated. No it’s been five years. But I’m not ok for ten. 
What else? I remember Eddie and Seth wrestling at my pirate party 
In the playroom and I thought Seth was going to die 
That was before Eddie became reliably an Eddie 
I am very tired and I want to go to sleep. I think if i go to sleep right now then I would never get to take off my makeup 

Wait mom memories 

Mom picking me up at bak and being in her full work outfit in the waiting area and her smiling from her phone when I got there 
I was her favorite person to see, everyone else was not as special. I don’t have that with anyone else in that way anymore">

5 reasons that it doesn’t work, is this similar or different from what you have heard happiness described as in your life? 

Not too many bounds that they are not allowed in 

Tension between striving for more and contentment for what is 

Layman terms - position in a life story and then move from there

When happiness is conidtional, are you postponing your joy 

Do you ignore your happy self future prospects 

Between life experience and theory

Hi Madeline---
    Good questions---would take it about the same time everyday---the levels are more consistent.
    Would avoid excessive alcohol while on this medicine--one glass of wine or one beer once or twice a week should be fine.  
     Was thinking about medications Madeline---the Citalopram is a good choice though it has some interactions with some antibiotics ----was thinking Prozac--Fluoxetine might be good choice as it doesn't have those issues and you won't feel bad if you miss a dose once in awhile.
     If agreeable to you--would like to prescribe Fluoxetine 20mg--have you take 1/2 tablet (10 mg)  in the morning starting tomorrow for the next 5 days--if you are feeling well--then you can go up to the whole tablet after that.
The side effects some can notice are mild headache or nausea.  Those usually will dissapate as your body get">

Cliff and Diana, 
I hope that coming off of the holiday rush has gone well! I just wanted to send a note that I ended up getting some new earrings that I’m super excited about! They are a slightly more mature step in terms of that jewelry that I usually wear. Sending love your way!!
